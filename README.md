# Data Science Certificate Project Summer 2019

In the Summer of 2019, I took the University of Arkansas Global Campus Data Science Certificate Course. Data Science is a every growing and changing field. My teachers were trying to introduce us to the field by giving us a foundation on thinking like a Data Scientist. We learned vocabulary, strategies on thinking about the problems in Data Science and when you use certain models. We even had the opportunity to pick a real-world problem and use it for our project that we were going to present at the end of the course. What an undertaking!!!! 

We learned. 
+ Data Wrangling
+ Data Munging
+ Feature Engineering
+ Model Selection
+ Visualization

It was challenging and I was eager to learn how to use my new found skills. This repository is a small glimpse into how our data science certificate course. I would recommend to any well-balanced engineer looking for the next step in his or her career.
