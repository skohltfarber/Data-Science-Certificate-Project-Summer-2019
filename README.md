# Data Science Certificate Project Summer 2019

In the Summer of 2019, I took the University of Arkansas Global Campus Data Science Certificate Course. Data Science is a every growing and changing field. My teachers were trying to introduce us to the field by giving us a foundation on thinking like a Data Scientist. We learned vocabulary, strategies on thinking about the problems in Data Science and when you use certain models. We even had the opportunity to pick a real-world problem and use it for our project that we were going to present at the end of the course. What an undertaking!!!! 

We learned. 
+ Data Wrangling
+ Data Munging
+ Feature Engineering
+ Model Selection
+ Visualization

It was challenging and I was eager to learn how to use my new found skills. This repository is a small glimpse into how our data science certificate course. I would recommend to any well-balanced engineer looking for the next step in his or her career.

# My Project

Since 2014, I have been in the Banking Industry. I have been introduced to many areas that Data Science could help gain valuable insight. I have been noticing that there has been a many mergers and acquisitions. According to [iBanknet Bank Mergers and Acquisitions List of 6/30/2019]( http://www.ibanknet.com/scripts/callreports/fiList.aspx?type=bankmanda), there has been 447 from 1/1/2018 to 9/3/2019. We found a great Datasource for bank descriptions from [FDIC Summary of Deposits (SOD) from DATA.GOV 2017]( https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/fdic-summary-of-deposits-sod-download-file).
